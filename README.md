## Description 

Do you want an unforgettable experience browsing the internet? Look no further than the “Internet Ruining Experience Twitch Edition.” With this handy extension, it will change several keywords to your favorite twitch slang. Words such as away, happy, lying, lie, angry, sad, laughing, laugh, are all changed to several different words. Words such as AFK, POG, cap, salt, feelsbadman, and OMEGALUL. Whether it’s a capitalized or not too! This Chrome extension also has the ability to play a sound too! If you click the small badge icon where extensions are at the top right. You can play a popular contagious laugh. Just make sure your sound isn’t too loud! If you need to pause it, then you can do that too by just clicking the little badge icon again. Then if you haven’t noticed already since it’s been activated, all images have changed to everybody’s favorite Twitch emote, Komodo Hype! It will also change width based on the original image’s width so it doesn’t take up the whole page! The only catch is that if Chrome has already loaded the images on the page, Komodo gets shy and won’t come back. However, who’s better to make your day browsing image viewing sites if they’re all changed to the same image of everybody’s favorite reptile.
